# Linear-Regression-Housing-Prices
Developed a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on features such as size, number of bedrooms, and location. Utilized the DataHandler class for dataset preprocessing and implemented the linear regression algorithm from scratch. Trained the model and calculated Mean Squared Error (MSE) for evaluation.
